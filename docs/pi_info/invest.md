# Investment Program

## Intent
The investment program is for researchers or projects who want dedicated resources from ARC over some period of time:

* For long-term (1-5 year) project needs
* Reserved compute hardware via dedicated partition (with preemptable overlay)
* Expansion of Project or Work via quota increase
* Available via MOU
* Submit consultation request for more information [Help](https://arc.vt.edu/help)  

If you are less interested in _dedicated_ hardware and just want to use more resources than ARC provides for free -- for example, in bursts before conference deadlines -- you might instead consider the [Cost Center](costcenter).

## Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
An investment Memoradum Of Understanding (MOU) is updated and made available for each new cluster as it comes online. The current MOU covers [TinkerCliffs](tinkercliffs).

For example investment MOUs, see below:
* [Compute](mous/MOU-Cascades-Investment-Computing-2019-COMPUTE.pdf)
* [Storage](mous/MOU-Cascades-Investment-Computing-2019-five-year-storage.pdf)

## Interested?
If you have interest in learning more about the Investment Computing Program for [TinkerCliffs](tinkercliffs) please contact [Terry Herdman](terry.herdman@vt.edu). ARC can provide a brief presentation on the Investment Computing program at department meetings or to research teams if desired.
