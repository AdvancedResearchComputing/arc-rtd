# Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources Statement

The following is a draft Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources statement that researchers can include in research proposals:

Computing resources will be provided through Advanced Research Computing (ARC) within the Division of Information Technology at Virginia Tech. ARC provides cutting-edge high-performance computing and visualization resources. Currently available high performance computing (HPC) systems include: 

1. **TinkerCliffs**: a general purpose CPU cluster. This cluster has approximately 40,000 AMD Rome CPU cores, HDR Infiniband offering 100 Gbps throughput, nodes for high-memory applications, an additional 16 Intel Xeon AP nodes and four nodes with eight NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs each
2. **Infer**: GPU-based cluster made up of 58 compute nodes with a total of 4 NVIDIA Volta V100 GPUs, 18 NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPUs, and 80 NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs; Infiniband interconnect
3. **Cascades**: General purpose cluster with 190 compute nodes equipped with two 16-core Intel Xeon “Broadwell” CPU and 128 GB of memory; 38 compute nodes equipped with two 12-core Intel Xeon Skylake CPU, 376 GB of memory, and two NVIDIA V100 GPU; 4 compute nodes with two NVIDIA K80 GPU, 512 GB of memory and one 2 TB NVMe flash card; 2 four-socket compute nodes with four 18-core Intel Xeon “Broadwell” CPU and 3 TB of memory; Mellanox EDR Infiniband interconnect
4. **Dragonstooth**: High-throughput cluster with 48 two-socket compute nodes equipped with two 12-core Intel Xeon “Haswell” CPU, 256 GB of memory and four 480GB SSD drives

Parallel filesystems provide over 11 Petabytes of high performance storage, and a tape archive is provided to support long term data storage. 

ARC’s Visionarium Lab also provides an array of visualization resources, including the VisCube, an immersive 10′ x 10′ three-dimensional visualization environment. In all, the VT Visionarium provides nearly 86 million pixels, 4 billion triangles-per-second and 22 TB/s of GPU memory bandwidth. ARC resources are able to leverage Virginia Tech’s excellent network connectivity, and network. Virginia offers access to advanced national networks, including ESnet, Internet2, and Mid Atlantic Crossroads. 

**Upcoming Resources**

In the next year, ARC plans to release additional resources supporting:

5. **Protected data**: This will be a dedicated cluster and storage supporting data needing elevated protections. This cluster will be available early in the winter of 2021-2022.
6. **AI/ML**: Additional nodes will be added to the TinkerCliffs cluster to support AI/ML applications. Scheduled to be released in late Spring 2022.
7. **Cloud**: Kubernetes resource for cloud-like applications.
