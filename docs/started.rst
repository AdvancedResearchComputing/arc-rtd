If you are interested in using ARC\'s resources for your current or future projects, or if you would just like to learn more about our computing systems and services, please `request a consultation <https://arc.vt.edu/help>`_ or drop by our `office hours <https://arc.vt.edu/office-hours/>`_. You do not need to have any prior experience with high-performance computing â€” our team can assist you in determining the right system for your project. 

If you would like to peruse a bit before you reach out, you are welcome to review our :ref:`hardware offerings <resources>`, `request an account <https://arc.vt.edu/account>`_, or watch our :ref:`video tutorials <video>`.

We also offer introductory training sessions throughout the year via the `Professional Development Network <https://profdev.tlos.vt.edu/>`_ and our computational scientists are available for `classroom presentations <https://arc.vt.edu/classroom_presentations/>`_ on high-performance, parallel, scientific, or other research computing topics.
